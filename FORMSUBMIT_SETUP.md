# FormSubmit Setup Instructions

## ✅ What Was Changed

I've updated your consultation form to use **FormSubmit** - a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email without requiring any email client permissions or asking users for permissions.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Get Free Consultation" button
2. Modal popup appears with the form
3. User fills in Name, Phone, and Address
4. User clicks Submit
5. **Form data is sent DIRECTLY to theinteriorwallah@gmail.com** via FormSubmit
6. User sees a success page
7. You receive an email with the customer details

## 📧 First-Time Setup (IMPORTANT!)

**You need to do this ONLY ONCE:**

1. Open your website: http://localhost:8000
2. Click "Get Free Consultation" button
3. Fill in ANY test data (Name: "Test", Phone: "1234567890", Address: "Test")
4. Click Submit
5. **You will be redirected to a FormSubmit confirmation page**
6. **Check your email (theinteriorwallah@gmail.com)** - you'll receive an activation email from FormSubmit
7. **Click the activation link** in that email
8. Done! From now on, all form submissions will come directly to your email
